You work for a failing company that has not produced the best results for the shareholders
over the last couple years. As the pressure mounts the bosses get more and more desperate
in order to have a profitable quarter.
As project lead, the company has tasked you with creating the newest technology.
The company has also gone ahead and hand picked a team for you with the "best of the best".

Talk to your team members and search the area to solve the problems and push your tech onto
the market. 
Based on the Software Development Life Cycle choose the best responses for the problems given.
  


System Planning 

- Define the Problem

Without giving you the details the company expects a lot from you, only telling you that they
"Want a new idea that will bring profit and secure for the company" The problem you are 
facing seems to be quite vague. The team has met and conversed and come up with a few ideas
in terms of what to create for the future. 

	Small good 
		- People from the team have become increasing interested in wearable tech,
		with team members purchasing iPhone watches. Perhaps creating a watch that 
		can work with both iPhone and Android is a good move to make.  

	Small bad 
		- The team has suggested that we just buy a bunch of fake iPhones from 
		the Chinese market and rebrand them and translate them into English. 

	Big good 
		- 

	Big Bad
		-A member of the team remembers reading something about nanotechnology and 
		cybernetic bodily enhancements. He thinks that pushing an untested and 
		slightly dangerous technology is a ballsy move that could push the company
		into the future.   

- Resource Plan 
I know the company has given you a monumental task to come up with something to save the 
company. But we need to distribute our resources appropriately in order to increase 
efficiency. 

	Small good
		- You look at previous jobs that your team members have done and their job
		within the project and assign roles based on that. 
	Small bad
		- Since the project is in its early phase it doesn’t really matter who works
		on what so let every pick the job they want to have no matter what their skills
		are in that area.  

	Big good
		- You ask all your employees to list what skills they have and send them to
		you. You look at the skills and jobs ahead and assign an employee to each one. 
	Big bad
		- Stressed with the task that you face, you decided that you should let
		fate decided who does what. You write the jobs on a piece of paper and 
		the names of all your employees on the other. You close your eyes and 
		at random point to a name and job. 



- Budget 
The company doesn't really have a blank check to give us for this project, in fact I don't
think they have any cheques left to right, but they did give us a chance to write a proposal
to say how much we need. 

	Small good
		- You think that in a crunch the team could pull it off with a conservative
		budget, but this also leaves room for you to go over budget. 
	Small bad
		- You decide to calculate the value of each team members life savings based 
		on nothing but pure speculation. You add it together, put a zero on the end
		and send the boss an email saying "We need this amount of money". 
	Big Good
		- Bring the team together and ask them based on their skills what they think 
		the budget should be, both with R&D, building and production. Giving you
		the best possible chance to stay within budget.  
	
	Big Bad
		- Ditch every idea you have had so far and go with the cybernetic bodily 
		enhancements and ask the company for nothing short of a fortune to get
		it off the ground. 


- Schedule 
I hear the company is in a tight spot right now and can't afford any delays or we are all
out of a job. We should probably set some time lines so that we can get this product to 
market. 

	Small good
		- You set sprints and smaller due dates to get the project on track.

	Small bad
		- You send an end date in the future and tell the team the project must be 
		done by that date, keeping the team on a tight leash 

	Big Good
		- Each team member has to report on how much time they think is required 
		for each section of the project. Based on the teams report you create the 
		schedule for the project. 

	Big bad
		- As project lead you don’t think that a time line would solve anything.
		Its going to get done when it gets done. Let the team be free and work at 
		liesure. 


- Feasibility 
I have doubts that this product is going to be feasible on the market and think that we should 
have another look at just exactly we are trying to do.  

	Small good
		 - Reassure him that the team has been hand picked and that we need to support our team as much 			as we can.
		
	small bad
		-Ignore the complaint and tell the employee that if they speak out again they
		will be off the project.

	big good
		- Within the group you decide to have a debate and appoint the employee who
		had the concern to the "con" side and have someone else appointed to the
		"pro" side. 

	big bad	
		- You think that anything can be done you ignore the complaint and proceed
		to tell the employee about a more grand idea that is completely beyond the 
		realm of possibility. 

Systems Analysis 

- Gather Information
I think that this is a good idea what we are trying to do, but I think that more information 
is needed before we can proceed with peace of mind. 

	small good
		- On your own time research a few things and apply them to the project.
	small bad
		- Wikipedia is a reliable resource, check there for any information you need 
	big good
		- Based on the skills on your employees, assign a member to do research based
		on the missing information your team needs.
	big bad
		- Check to see if there is a Reddit page about it, if not create one, and 
		proceed to start the discussion.


- Define System Requirements 
So I was looking over all the requirements that this thing is going to need and I think we are going to need to consider what will be the main functions of the prototype?

	small good
	 - Get a list of ideas for the main functions and go through and define with your 	workers what functions will be in the prototype

	small bad
	- You hand pick functions that you want to be in the prototype 

	big good 
	- Converse with your work team and decide which flaws and talents the crew has to 	decide what will be the main functions of the prototype.

	big bad
	- Make sure that the prototype has just enough for it to be alright



- Build Prototypes 
Boss, I think that we need a prototype of this product to ensure user compatibility and 
functionality. How complex should we make this thing. 

	small good
	- Reassure that as long as we push out a working and non bug filled product at launch it will do well on 		the market.

	small bad
	
	big good
	- Look back on the plans of the original design and develop the original then consider small things to add 		into the design once the main product is working well and will appeal to the customers.
	big bad
	- Put loads of miniature add ons on the product, working or not, as long as it catches the customers eye. 		We will be sure to get them to purchase the product. 


- Prioritize Requirements 
Boss, we are falling behind on schedule and we won’t be able to push out on some of the watches features. What should we do?

	small good
	-Perfect the features we have on the watch and scrap the other features.


	small bad
	- Move on from the applications you’ve almost finished and start the main focus on the other applications.


	big good
	- Polish the features we have done. We will guarantee a line up after launch of applications that will be 		free to the public once released.

	big bad
	- Skip to the features we need to finish, the consumers will enjoy more things to do when the watch finally 		launches.

- Design application architecture / network 



- Design user interface 



- design system interfaces 


- Design and integrate DataBase 


- Design system controls 



System Implementations

- Verify and Test
Yo Boss, Jermey is testing the prototype out and says that it keeps leaving rashes, what should you propose we do?

	small good - get Jermey to go to the doctor and investigate the prototype with another tester
	small bad - Fire Jermey for not being able to test your unique product
	
	best good - Send Jermey home, investigate the prototype and consider changing the material of band used on the product.

	Very Bad - Its going to be fine. 


-Convert Data 



- Train Users & Document System



- Install the System




System and Security 

- Maintain the system


- Enhance the System
Boss, how should we go about making the security for our prototype? Should we go high or low?
small good - go high, make sure none of those people get in our systems.
good - go high, we need to prevent hackers and other sites from building there own programs to modify the software we have already built inside the device for the customer.
small bad - go high, just be cheap about it
bad - Do we really need security for a watch? 


- Support the users
What should we do to help the users once we ship the product out?
small good - Include a phone/email for users to contact us on
small bad - Just stick it in small fine print in the instructions, make it a game for them.
good - Create a hotline for users to call in complaints and questions about the product and an online email address where you can communicate with users as well as social media

bad - Honestly? It should be so simple to handle. If they don’t know how to do it from the start how can they turn on their tv for crying out loud.
